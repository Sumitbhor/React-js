## 6. Stability of Ecosystem in Sustainable Environment

### 📌 Definition of Ecosystem Stability

> Ecosystem stability refers to the **ability of an ecosystem to resist disturbances (resistance) and recover from them (resilience)** while maintaining its essential structure and functions.

### Types of Stability

| Type | Definition | Example |
|------|-----------|--------|
| **Resistance Stability** | Ability to resist disturbances and remain unchanged | Old-growth forests resist pest attacks |
| **Resilience Stability** | Ability to recover quickly after a disturbance | Grasslands recover quickly after fire |
| **Inertia** | Resistance to displacement from current state | Mature forest vs. grassland after drought |
| **Constancy** | Maintenance of variables within acceptable limits | Population size remaining relatively stable |

### Factors That Promote Ecosystem Stability

- ✅ **High Biodiversity** — More species → more functional redundancy → greater stability
- ✅ **Complex Food Webs** — Multiple energy pathways buffer against species loss
- ✅ **Efficient Nutrient Cycling** — Carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus cycles maintain productivity
- ✅ **Stable Energy Flow** — Consistent solar energy input sustains producers
- ✅ **Absence of Invasive Species** — Native species maintain established ecological relationships
- ✅ **Intact Soil Microbiome** — Healthy decomposers ensure nutrient cycling

### Threats to Ecosystem Stability

- ❌ Deforestation and habitat destruction
- ❌ Pollution (air, water, soil)
- ❌ Introduction of invasive alien species
- ❌ Climate change and global warming
- ❌ Overexploitation of natural resources
- ❌ Urbanization and land-use change

### Role in Sustainable Development

> **Sustainable Development** (Brundtland Commission, 1987): *"Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs."*

A stable ecosystem is the **foundation of sustainable development**. Conservation, ecological restoration, and wise use of ecosystems are the three pillars of sustainability.
